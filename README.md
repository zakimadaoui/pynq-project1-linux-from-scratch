## General steps for booting linux from scratch
-  Fetch sources
-  Build FSBL
-  Build U-boot 
-  Build and modify a root filesystem
-  Build a device tree blob
-  Build the linux kernel
-  Create a boot image using bootgen or mkboot 
-  Prepare the boot medium. In my case SDCARD with FAT32 fs and copy the files into it


## Dependencies:
- Download Xilinx bootgen and PATH must include it
- download the cross compiler
```bash
sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf # and dependencies
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi-gcc # and dependencies
sudo apt install bison flex openssl libssl-dev 
sudo apt-get install uuid-dev libgnutls28-dev 
sudo apt install pkg-config meson ninja-build # needed for building dtc

```

## Bootgen/mkzynqboot
TBD

## FSBL for zynq:
- https://github.com/Xilinx/embeddedsw/blob/master/lib/sw_apps/zynq_fsbl/misc/Readme.txt for build
- https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1283-bootgen-user-guide
- https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18841798/Build+FSBL
- https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/439124055/Zynq-7000+FSBL


Zynq FSBL has 3 directories.
	1. data - It contains files for SDK
	2. src  - It contains the FSBL source files
	3. misc - It contains miscellaneous files required to
		  compile FSBL.
		  Builds for zc702, zc706 and zed boards are supported.

How to compile Zynq FSBL:
    0. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/embeddedsw
```
	1.Go to the Fsbl src directory "lib/sw_apps/zynq_fsbl/src/"
	2. make "BOARD=<>" "CC=<>"
		a. Values for BOARD  are zc702, zc706, zed
		b. Value for CC is arm-none-eabi-gcc. Default value is also same.
	3.Give "make" to compile the fsbl with BSP. By default it is
	  built for zc702 board with arm-none-eabi-gcc compiler
	4.Below are the examples for compiling for different options
		a. To generate Fsbl for zc706 board
			i.make "BOARD=zc706"
		b.To generate Fsbl for zc702 board with debug enable
		  and RSA support
			i.make "BOARD=zc702" "CFLAGS=-DFSBL_DEBUG_INFO -DRSA_SUPPORT"
		c.To generate Fsbl for zc706 board and compile with arm-none-eabi-gcc
		  with MMC support
			i.make "BOARD=zc706" "CC=arm-none-eabi-gcc" "CFLAGS=-DMMC_SUPPORT"


## Generating and compiling the device tree:
- https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18842279/Build+Device+Tree+Blob
- https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/341082130/Quick+guide+to+Debugging+Device+Tree+Generator+Issues

**Important note for the future** when desiring to extend the device tree in a yocto project or similar:
Since the DTG uses the XSA as an input file, and the XSA only contains IPs that are in the Block Design, then for the same reason the DTS output from the DTG will only have DT nodes for the IP in the BD. A user can add include files to the device tree (similar to how this would be achieved in C/C++). These are called DTSI files. In PetaLinux, users can use the `system-user.dtsi` template to add, or modify nodes in the DT. 


## U-boot

- https://docs.kernel.org/arch/arm/booting.html
- https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ/blob/master/boards/Pynq-Z2/petalinux_bsp/meta-user/recipes-bsp/u-boot/files/
- 
- It seems that because i want to use the FSBL from xilinx, SPL from u-boot should be disabled and is not needed

Essentially, the boot loader should provide (as a minimum) the following:

- Setup and initialise the RAM.
- Initialise one serial port.
- Detect the machine type.
- Setup the kernel tagged list.
- Load initramfs.
- Call the kernel image.

The boot loader must load a device tree image (dtb) into system ram at a 64bit aligned address and initialize it with the boot data. The dtb format is documented at https://www.devicetree.org/specifications/. The kernel will look for the dtb magic value of 0xd00dfeed at the dtb physical address to determine if a dtb has been passed instead of a tagged list.

The boot loader must pass at a minimum the size and location of the system memory, and the root filesystem location. The dtb must be placed in a region of memory where the kernel decompressor will not overwrite it, while remaining within the region which will be covered by the kernel’s low-memory mapping.

**A safe location is just above the 128MiB boundary from start of RAM.**

### TODOs
[ ] make menuconfig // after you load the default config for the board to see what configuration is in there
[ ] i need to check if building uboot produces a boot.scr file 
[ ] as an experiment use HLD flow to export ps7_init_gpl.c and ps7_init_gpl.h and use them for generating a uboot SPL as a replacement from FSBL.

### Q/A 
- [x] How does FSBL handoff control to U-boot or binary application ? bootm command. !
- [x] does u-boot control how linux finds the device tree blob and rootfs ?? or how does linux find it in the first place ? flatload !
- [ ] how do i know which addresses should i load the linux uImage, device tree blob and rootfs ramdisk to before i use the bootm command.
    - look at examples like petalinux or yocto
- [x] Also can this be automated such that linux boots automatically ? yes using boot.scr scripts


Clone u-boot git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/u-boot-xlnx.git
cd to u-boot directory "cd u-boot-xlnx".
Add tool chain to path and then set tool chain as below(tool chain name may vary based on toll chain version).
Zynq:
```bash
    export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
    export ARCH=arm
```

Configuring U-Boot (>= 2020.1 Release)
For 2020.1 and above releases common defconfig is being made. 
All Zynq (except for mini) ->	xilinx_zynq_virt_defconfig

To build U-boot for ZC702 board, follow below steps. 
```bash
make distclean
make xilinx_zynq_virt_defconfig
export DEVICE_TREE="zynq-zc702"
make
```

**NOTE1:** device tree can be found under arch/arm/dts/ with the name zynq-zc702.dts
**NOTE2:** A compiled device tree blob (.dtb) with the name zynq-zc702.dtb will be generated under arch/arm/dts after the build.


To build U-boot for ZCU102 rev1.0 board, follow below steps.
```bash
make distclean
make xilinx_zynqmp_virt_defconfig
export DEVICE_TREE="zynqmp-zcu102-rev1.0"
make
```
device tree can be found under arch/arm/dts/ with the name zynqmp-zcu102-rev1.0.dts.
Similarly one can find for all other zynqmp/zynq boards with matching name.

To make mkimage available in other steps, it is recommended to add the tools directory to your $PATH.
cd tools
export PATH=`pwd`:$PATH

the kernel build process automatically creates an additional image, with the ".ub" suffix. linux.bin.ub is the Linux binary image wrapped with a U-Boot header. The Linux compilation process will automatically invoke mkimage, therefore, it is important to include the path to the U-Boot tools in the PATH environment variable.


Once the kernel, root filesystem, and device tree images are present in memory, the command to boot Linux is:
```bash
U-Boot> bootm <addr of kernel> <addr of rootfs> <addr of device tree blob (dtb)>
```
Note: Make sure the kernel and root filesystem images are wrapped by with the U-Boot header. The device tree blob does not need to be wrapped with the U-Boot header.


## Booting from SD Card
For example, when booting from MMC devices (SD card or eMMC), the following script is run from the boot.scr file by default in the Xilinx-provided U-Boot environment.  This can be modified based on your needs. 


```c
if test "${boot_target}" = "mmc0" || test "${boot_target}" = "mmc1" ; then
   if test -e ${devtype} ${devnum}:${distro_bootpart} /image.ub; then
      fatload ${devtype} ${devnum}:${distro_bootpart} 0x10000000 image.ub;
      bootm 0x10000000;
      exit;
   fi
   if test -e ${devtype} ${devnum}:${distro_bootpart} /Image; then
      fatload ${devtype} ${devnum}:${distro_bootpart} 0x00200000 Image;;
   fi
   if test -e ${devtype} ${devnum}:${distro_bootpart} /system.dtb; then
      fatload ${devtype} ${devnum}:${distro_bootpart} 0x00100000 system.dtb;
   fi
   if test -e ${devtype} ${devnum}:${distro_bootpart} /rootfs.cpio.gz.u-boot; then
      fatload ${devtype} ${devnum}:${distro_bootpart} 0x04000000 rootfs.cpio.gz.u-boot;
      booti 0x00200000 0x04000000 0x00100000
      exit;
   fi
   booti 0x00200000 - 0x00100000
   exit;
fi 
```


Boot application images
U-Boot provides bootm command to boot application images (i.e. Linux) which expects those images be wrapper with a U-Boot specific header using mkimage. This command can be used either to boot legacy U-Boot images or new multi component images (FIT) as documented in U-Boot images wiki page. The standard Linux build process builds the wrapper uImage and Petalinux projects generates by default the multi component FIT image as well.

The following U-Boot commands illustrate loading a Linux image from a SD card using either individual images and a FIT image using the bootm command.
```bash
u-boot> fatload mmc 0 0x3000000 uImage
u-boot> fatload mmc 0 0x2A00000 devicetree.dtb
u-boot> fatload mmc 0 0x2000000 uramdisk.image.gz
u-boot> bootm 0x3000000 0x2000000 0x2A00000
```
or 
```bash
u-boot> fatload mmc 0 0x1000000 image.ub
u-boot> bootm 0x1000000
```


```
setenv bootargs "root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait" # od this if the rootfs is in you sdcard..... 
setenv bootcmd "fatload mmc 0 0x1000000 image.ub && bootm 0x1000000"
saveenv
```

With the bootm command, U-Boot is relocating the images before it boots Linux such that the addresses above may not be what the kernel sees. U-Boot also alters the device tree to tell the kernel where the ramdisk image is located in memory (initrd-start and initrd-end). The
bootm command sets the r2 register to the address of the device tree in memory which is not done by the go command.
The differences and use cases of using the booti commands and the bootm command have evolved over time.  As of U-Boot 2020.01, the primary difference is in handling of uncompressed Linux Image files (common for 64-bit Arm platforms) versus compressed Linux zImage files (common on 32-bit Arm platforms) as denoted in the U-Boot help.  As a general rule of thumb, only differentiate in usage depending on Linux image type rather than solely based on architecture.
booti - boot Linux kernel 'Image' format from memory
bootm - boot application image from memory


## Creating the SD card

```
sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0


```

## QEMU
If you had U-Boot built for zynq_zc706:

```bash
qemu-system-arm \
  -M xilinx-zc706 \
  -m 1024M \
  -serial mon:stdio \
  -serial null \
  -kernel u-boot.elf
```

Or to boot a Linux kernel:

```bash
qemu-system-arm \
  -M xilinx-zc706 \
  -m 1024M \
  -serial mon:stdio \
  -kernel uImage \
  -dtb devicetree.dtb \
  -initrd rootfs.cpio.gz \
  -append "console=ttyPS0,115200 earlyprintk"
```


## Linux kernel build config:
# Yocto KERNEL Variables
UBOOT_ENTRYPOINT  ?= "0x200000"
UBOOT_LOADADDRESS ?= "0x200000"
KERNEL_EXTRA_ARGS += "UIMAGE_LOADADDR=${UBOOT_ENTRYPOINT}"
